#### Description

This is a remaked version of Minecraft mod Custom Player Model (CPM). It allows you to customize ingame models using JSON files, with advanced features including scripting, particle systems and physics simulation.

Note: Although this mod is named Custom "Player" Model, it also allows you to apply custom models on animals or monsters.

#### Installation

Download the mod jar file and put it in the "mods" directory under your minecraft main directory. When ingame, press Ctrl+M to open the model selection gui.

Each model is a .zip file. Model files should be put in "custom-model/models" directory under your minecraft main directory. If this directory does not exist, create one yourself or launch the game to create it automatically.

#### FAQ

**I want some new features / find some bugs!**

You can rise new issues at [github issue tracker](https://github.com/Gamepiaynmo/CustomPlayerModel/issues). Or you can contact me at [Custom Player Model Discord](https://discord.gg/uVT39n5).

**Is this mod client side or server side?**

I would say both. You can have this only at client side so that only yourself can see custom models. Or you can have a modded server which enables every player with this mod to see the models.
